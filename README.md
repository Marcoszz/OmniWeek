# Project: Be The Hero

Web/Mobile application developed in JavaScript using Node.js, React and React Native. The main goal of the project is to create a space 
where NGOs can make a profile and register cases that need financial investment, so the users can contact and help theses NGOs !


## Starting the project

First, you will need to install all the project's depedencies running: **npm install**. (backend, frontend and mobile) 

(If there's a missing one, you can see the specific depedencies of the whole project reading each *depedencies* files in the 3 main folders [backend, frontend, mobile])

### Web

Run **npm start** in *backend* to create the server connection and then run **npm start** in the *frontend* to see the application working in the *localhost*. The port used is the **3000**. You can change it.

### Mobile

See the application working on your own cellphone using Expo. After installing the tool with npm and the app in your cellphone (search for Expo), run **expo start** (or **npm start**) in *mobile* and then use the QR code available in the terminal or in the *localhost* given to work.  

After all theses steps, you can change the application and see the results in real time ! Thanks and have fun :)
